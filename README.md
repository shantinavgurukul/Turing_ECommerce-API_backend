# Turing_EECommerce-API_backend
In this project, I have made a backend of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS. 
I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify the if the customer is valid or not. 
We are already given the mysql-database in which there are different tables and their data. 
We've to write different queries for different endpoints to make them working.
